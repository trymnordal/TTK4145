# Exercise 9


Task 1:
  1. We assign priorities to tasks because some tasks are more urgent or important than other.
  
  2. For a scheduler to be usable in real-time systems all deadlines have to be met at the right time and the scheduling have to be predictable.
  
Task 2:
  1. Without priority inheritance:
  
|Task|0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|10|11|12|13|14|
|----|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|--|--|--|--|--|
| a  | | | | |E| | | | | |  |Q |V |E |  |
| b  | | |E|V| |V|E|E|E| |  |  |  |  |  |
| c  |E|Q| | | | | | | |Q|Q |  |  |  |E |
